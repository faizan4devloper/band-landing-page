Hi Anant,

Good afternoon!

To answer your question, the FAQ, reviews, ratings, and similar elements in the Citizen Advisor live chat feature are managed through separate code components. Each of these features has its own dedicated implementation, allowing for better modularity and maintainability in the UI.

If you need any further details or have more questions, feel free to ask!

Thanks,
Faizan
