Data Ingestion Pipeline-Automated data ingestion pipeline to process documents at scale.
• Document Text Extraction – Depending upon the document type (Audio, PDF, FAQ etc.), respective pipeline is triggered to extract text, tabular data from the documents.
• Data Chunking – To enable contextual storage and retrieval, large documents are split into smaller chunks.
• Vector Embedding Generation – All chunks are then processed to generate vector embeddings, which are stored in a vector database. This allows data querying and similarity-based searches using the vector embeddings.
Natural Language Q&A -Interactive GUI enables users to –
• Ask questions related to the products/policies in a very natural language way.
• The system checks relevant matching documents from the ingested knowledge repository.
• Based on the context, Gen AI model (LLM) generates the contextual response back to the user.
