      description: "Email EAR (Extract, Act and Respond) In todayâ€™s era, there are unprecedented ways of engaging the customer and this includes both traditional and digital channels. Unified experience across channels is key for customer delight.Despite the rise of alternative options, Email remains a preferred communication channel for customer support. Email provides unique benefits like maintaining a history of interactions, allowing customers to comprehensively explain issues, and enabling file attachments for additional context. However, the prioritization and queuing of emails often leads to delayed responses that create poor customer experiences. Our Gen AI-powered Email EAR (Extract, Act, and Respond) solution aims to transform the customer support process by automating the reading, analysis, and thoughtful responding to incoming emails. Specifically, our system can extract the core query, complaint, or issue within an email. It then understands what actions are required to resolve the customer's needs. Finally, it generates a user-friendly, detailed response explaining steps taken to address their questions or concerns.",

      description: "Signature Extraction & Verification Signatures are unique to each person and can be used to verify identity and authorize documents. Extracting signatures from documents and verifying their authenticity is crucial for security, preventing forgery and ensuring validity of legal agreements. AI/ML algorithms can analyze shape, stroke style and pressure to accurately match signatures. Automating extraction and verification improves efficiency and allows large volumes of documents to be quickly processed. Below is the expected outcome from the solution:- The proposed system will have the ability to search through scanned or faxed multi-page documents to identify and extract any handwritten signatures present.  Once a signature is extracted, it can be compared against reference signatures stored in an Imaging Signature Verification database to determine if the extracted signature matches or mismatches a known signature.",
      solutionFlow: "Signature detection and Extraction: The system will be able to process scanned or faxed documents of multiple pages. It will search through the document images to identify signatures that appear to be handwritten. These identified signatures will then be extracted from the larger document image as separate signature image files. As signatures may appear on different pages and in different locations within the documents, the system will have robust capabilities to detect and extract these signatures regardless of placement. Signature Matching/Verification: The extracted signature images will be compared against known specimen signatures stored in the Imaging Signature Verification database or uploaded during the process. Deep Learning CNN based Siamese Network will be trained and deployed to determine if the extracted signature sufficiently matches a reference signature to consider it verified. A match percentage score can be generated to indicate the level of similarity.",
