      description: "Email EAR (Extract, Act and Respond) In todayâ€™s era, there are unprecedented ways of engaging the customer and this includes both traditional and digital channels. Unified experience across channels is key for customer delight. Despite the rise of alternative options, Email remains a preferred communication channel for customer support. Email provides unique benefits like maintaining a history of interactions, allowing customers to comprehensively explain issues, and enabling file attachments for additional context. However, the prioritization and queuing of emails often leads to delayed responses that create poor customer experiences. Our Gen AI-powered Email EAR (Extract, Act, and Respond) solution aims to transform the customer support process by automating the reading, analysis, and thoughtful responding to incoming emails. Specifically, our system can extract the core query, complaint, or issue within an email. It then understands what actions are required to resolve the customer's needs. Finally, it generates a user-friendly, detailed response explaining steps taken to address their questions or concerns.",

Extracting signatures from documents and verifying their authenticity is crucial for security, preventing forgery and ensuring validity of legal agreements. AI/ML algorithms can analyze shape, stroke style and pressure to accurately match signatures. Automating extraction and verification improves efficiency and allows large volumes of documents to be quickly processed. Below is the expected outcome from the solution:- The proposed system will have the ability to search through scanned or faxed multi-page documents to identify and extract any handwritten signatures present. Once a signature is extracted, it can be compared against reference signatures stored in an Imaging Signature Verification database to determine if the extracted signature matches or mismatches a known signature.",
