Here are a few suggestions to help debug the asset mapping:

1. Add console logging in mapAssets() to see the asset key and data being mapped:

```js
function mapAssets(card, assetData) {

  console.log('Mapping assets for:', assetKey, data);

  // ...

} 
```

2. Update the card data json files to have unique titles, rather than generic strings like "description". For example:

```json
{
  "title": "Email Extraction and Auto Response",
  //...
  "content": {
    "description": "emailEarDescription",
    // ...
  }
}
```

3. Make sure the asset key (card title) is formatted correctly - remove special chars, convert to camelcase etc.

4. Check that the asset keys in URLJson.json match the card titles.

This will help you trace the mapping process for each card and identify any issues with keys not matching up.

The main things to validate are:

- Card titles are unique 
- Asset key is derived correctly from title 
- Asset key exists in URLJson.json

Let me know if any issues come up while debugging the mapping! I'm happy to help further.

you are right, adding console logs helped me identify the issues. The asset keys were not matching up with the card titles in some cases due to formatting differences. I updated the card titles and asset keys to match, and now the mapping is working! Thank you for the debugging tips - it really helped pinpoint the problems.

Glad to hear the console logging helped identify the issues! Debugging data mapping like this can definitely be tricky until you trace through the mismatches. Nice work getting the asset keys and card titles aligned properly. The logging is a good technique to remember for debugging any data transformation issues in the future too. Happy I could help point you in the right direction! Let me know if any other questions come up.
